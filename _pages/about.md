>Joint anaesthetist and intensivist with experience and a track record in medical education, clinical research and data science.

Developing expertise in point of care echocardiography and ultrasound.  I have furthered my academic experience by undertaking additional study to gain an intercalated BSc in opioid pharmacology, MMedSci in Medical Education and PhD.  These additional skills in project management and delivery, data sciences and informatics have been invaluable in managing clinical projects, audit and quality improvement.
I have a wide range of experience across clinical specialties, and particularly enjoy the challenges of acute care, emergency and vascular anaesthesia.
